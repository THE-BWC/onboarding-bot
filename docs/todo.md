# TODO

## Bot management
- [x] Utilize Cogs to compartmentalize code.

## OpServ integration
- [ ] Check user against OpServ database for 'Inactive Reserve' status. This should block them from receiving any roles except 'Inactive Reserve'.
- [ ] Update user's nickname to match their rank and name from OpServ database. i.e `[E-6] Patrick`
- [ ] If the user is a member, then automatically update their nickname and assign appropriate roles.

## Onboarding
- [x] Ping the C&S for the game when onboarding submits.
